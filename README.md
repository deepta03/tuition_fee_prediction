# Tuition Fee Prediction
The goal of this project is to predict future tuition fees for international undergrad students at the University of Manitonba using machine larning. A manually curated  dataset based on the information from the University of Manitoba website was used for the prediction. The dataset contains the tuition rate per 3 credit hour science course for international students from 2012 to 2023. It is represented in a scatterplot capitalizing on python's matplotlib library. Later, the linear regression model from another library, scikit-learn was applied to predict the tuition fees for 2024, 2025 and 2026. To facilitate the apllication of the model, the values were rounded up in Excel.
